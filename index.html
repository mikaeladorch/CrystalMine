        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <h2>This game's concept is inspired by finding crystals with my sister on hiking adventures. We would find various crystals hiding, and I thought it would be great to create that experience into a game. </h2>
        <h3>In this game, the player is in a simulation of gathering crystals at a mining site.</h3>
      <h4>Once opening the crystal mining simulation, players are introduced to a start screen that switches to an instruction screen.</h4>
        <h5>Then, the player enters the mining field full of hidden crystals placed randomly. It's the player's job to collect all twenty crystals.</h5>
      <h6>In the finale, the player receives a surprise at the end screen.</h6>
